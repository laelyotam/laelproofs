# Lael's Proofs

**Author:** Kris Lael Uri Mayim Yotam (Kris Yotam)

## Overview

Welcome to Lael's Archive, a comprehensive repository documenting my journey through the vast landscape of mathematics. This archive will contain every mathematical book I acquire, along with my progress, solutions, and insights derived from these texts.

## Structure of the Archive

1. **Problem Solving Process**:
    - **Step 1: Paper Work** - I begin by solving problems on paper, working through each one to build intuition and rigor.
    - **Step 2: Handwritten Textbooks** - The most significant problems are transferred into my personalized, handwritten textbooks, serving as exemplars and reference points.
    - **Step 3: LaTeX Documentation** - Finally, every problem, after being refined and corrected, is meticulously typeset in LaTeX. This ensures the highest quality presentation of fully worked-out solutions.

2. **Areas of Mathematics**:
    - The repository is organized by areas of mathematics. Each section below is linked to a corresponding folder that contains books, notes, and solutions related to that topic.
  
### Mathematical Areas:

- [Algebra](./Algebra)
- [Geometry](./Geometry)
- [Calculus](./Calculus)
- [Number Theory](./Number-Theory)
- [Analysis](./Analysis)
- [Topology](./Topology)
- [Linear Algebra](./Linear-Algebra)
- [Probability & Statistics](./Probability-Statistics)
- [Discrete Mathematics](./Discrete-Mathematics)
- [Mathematical Logic](./Mathematical-Logic)
- [Differential Equations](./Differential-Equations)
- [Complex Analysis](./Complex-Analysis)
- [Abstract Algebra](./Abstract-Algebra)
- [Numerical Analysis](./Numerical-Analysis)
- [Combinatorics](./Combinatorics)
- [Set Theory](./Set-Theory)
- [Graph Theory](./Graph-Theory)
- [Category Theory](./Category-Theory)

Each link will take you to a folder where you can find books, notes, and fully worked-out solutions related to that area of study. As the archive grows, so will the depth and breadth of knowledge contained within.
